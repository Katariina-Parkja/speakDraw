## Requirements

 - A microphone with a mute button that fully mutes the input (some microphones might produce a "hum" even while muted). Has been tested with Jabra Speak 510.

 - A Nvidia GPU with a minumum of 10GB VRAM, however there are comments in code with possible changes to run it with less memory or on Apple Silicon.
